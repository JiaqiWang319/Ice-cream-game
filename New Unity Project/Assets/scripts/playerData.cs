/*INSTRUCTION
 * This function is to save the Data of each player, which include the ice cream they have, the total socre they have, and the score of each ice cream
 * we give a sign (icePlace1,....)to each ice cream card to show which place they are at.(0= table, 1=player1,2=player2,3=player3)
 * By this way, we can know all of the situation of all the ice cream card, so that we know which ice cream every player have
 * We use a function (position )to decide where the ice cream card is.
 * To avoid the recalculate of the total score, we clear the value of total score before every update.
 * To get the score of each ice cream, we use the static value in Function "iceceramData". 
 * To calcualte the total score, we just add the score of each ice cream to the totalscore.
